##  About <a name = "about"></a>

Here’s an overview of the web development process for the Udacity Travel App project:

1. **Planning and Design:** The initial phase involves defining project requirements and establishing the application's overall structure and layout. This includes creating wireframes, mockups, and determining the UI and UX elements to ensure a cohesive design.

2. **Front-end Development:** This stage focuses on building the visual and interactive aspects of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It involves developing the layout, styling, and user interface, as well as integrating any necessary third-party libraries or frameworks.

3. **Back-end Development:** The back-end phase centers on constructing the server-side components and logic. 

4. **APIs and Data Integration:** To provide users with travel-related information, the app integrates various APIs. These APIs enable the application to retrieve data from external sources, such as travel agencies, weather services, and mapping services, offering real-time updates on flight details, hotel availability, weather forecasts, and points of interest.

5. **Testing and Debugging:** Testing and debugging are vital to ensure the application functions correctly. This phase includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to identify and resolve any issues.

6. **Deployment:** After development and testing, the application is prepared for deployment. This involves setting up servers, databases, and domain names, and then launching the application in a production environment for user access.

7. **Maintenance and Updates:** Post-deployment, ongoing maintenance and updates are necessary. This includes monitoring performance, addressing user-reported issues, and implementing new features or improvements based on feedback.

##  Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will help you set up a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing. For information on deploying the project to a live system, refer to the [deployment](#deployment) section.

### Prerequisites

- **Web Browser:** A modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge is required to run and test the web application.

- **Text Editor or IDE:** A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is needed for writing and editing code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or JetBrains WebStorm.

- **Node.js:** If the project includes server-side development with Node.js, you must install the Node.js runtime. Node.js allows you to execute JavaScript on the server. Download the installer from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- **Package Manager:** You may need a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn to handle project dependencies and install external libraries or frameworks. npm comes with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically. Yarn can be installed separately by following the instructions on the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com).

- **Server-side Frameworks and Libraries:** If the project requires a server-side framework such as Express.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails, you will need to install the framework and any related dependencies. This can usually be done with a package manager (e.g., `npm install express`) or by following the framework’s documentation.


### Installing

you need the following:
npm install --save dev or npm install ----------> to install all the required dependencies
notice: you may still need to download the nodeomon as a dependency

make your env file with new names and add them to the server with the new names


to get the keys like username and weatherbit key you need to create them yourself and add them with different names
to the env file and still make the changes based on that

note : my Node.js version is  ---->   v18.16.1
## Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

npm run test will run jest in the terminal and get you the results
you are free to make more jest testing on your version of the project.


## Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Run: npm run build to generate the live version of a new build after installing the packages, setting up new environment keys, and configuring them correctly in the server functions.

Run: npm run start.

Run: npm run dev.
